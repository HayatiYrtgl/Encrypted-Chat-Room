# Login Page and Configuration file

Before start the GUI, you must set your configuration file, for ex: your name, connection port and host.

# How It Works
Client side connect previously opened port and host.
If Client side wants to cominicate healthly, side has to know secret question. For example ıf my side don't know secret question I will see all message but how ? 
It will consist of numbers (0238129, 98173211).
only one way to decrypt this message server side must tell to us what is secret key.

# Usage

First of all when you opened your CLİENT GUİ first time it will give many errors, close errors' windows and type secret key and send it will give many errors again close it and keep going.
when you send secret keys server response quickly and files will be sent by server side.
After that close the gui and open again don't worry for now you don't have to set your conf file again, don't forget it is the same connection.
