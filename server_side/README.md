# Server Side Requiriments 
In server sÄ±de you have to open your port with ngrok.
In server side we have two different python file.
First one is crypto generator

# CRYPTO GENERATOR
```pip install cryptography```
this python file create a server key and encrypted randomized dictionary, this the main usage of this file.
In our progress if client side know secret question server code will send what serverkey and encrypted dictionary have

# Server Side
```pip install socket```
Server code main usage is receiving the messages and distribute, if secret question come from client side the side send generated key and dictionary.
